# LocoMouse_cpp
### Author: Jo√£o Fayad (joaofayad@gmail.com)
This is a C++/OpenCV port of the core LocoMouse algorithm from Machado, Darmohray, Fayad, Marques, and Carey, eLife (2015): http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07892.

A MATLAB version of the algorithm can be found at https://github.com/careylab/LocoMouse_Dev. That version includes a user interface to set-up the tracking which allows to call this (C++/OpenCV) version as well. 

To set it up properly compile this source code with its dependencies and copy it to "LocoMouse_Root_Folder\LocoMouse_Tracker\auxiliary_functions\cpp".
